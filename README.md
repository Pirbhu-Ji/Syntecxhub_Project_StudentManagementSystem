#Syntecxhub_Project_StudentManagementSystem 

##Overview
This project is developed as part of my **Syntecxhub Java Internship (Week 2 Task)**.

It is a **console-based Student Management System** built using **Core Java**,
which allows user to manage student academic records easily. The system supports adding, 
displaying, searching, updating, and deleting student records. It also includes file 
handling so that records are saved permanently.

✅ Delete student record  
✅ Prevent duplicate Student IDs  
✅ Validate marks (0 – 100 range)  
✅ Automatically save records to file  
✅ Load records on program start  
✅ Fully modular OOP-based system  

##Technologies Used
- Java (OOP + Collections + File Handling)
- ArrayList for data storage
- Scanner for input handling
- Any Java-supported IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse)
- GitHub for version control
